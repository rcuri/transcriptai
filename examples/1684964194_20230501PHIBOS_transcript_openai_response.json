The Celtics and the 76ers are facing off in Boston tonight.\n[0:04] Reggie Miller: This is going to be a great game, Kevin. Both teams are coming into this game with a lot to prove.\n[0:09] Kevin Harlan: And the tip-off goes to the 76ers, with James Harden controlling the ball.\n[0:14] Reggie Miller: Harden with a quick step-back jumper, and it's good! That's the first points of the game.\n[0:19] Kevin Harlan: The Celtics are now on the offensive, with Jayson Tatum driving to the basket for a dunk! What a play!\n[0:25] Reggie Miller: And the 76ers miss a three-point shot. Looks like they're struggling to find their rhythm early on.\n[0:30] Kevin Harlan: Tatum with a nice pass to Al Horford for a layup! Celtics take the lead.\n[0:35] Reggie Miller: And Horford with a block on the 76ers' Paul Reed! He's not letting anything get past him.\n[0:41] Kevin Harlan: Tatum with the rebound, and he takes it to the hoop for another dunk! The Celtics are on fire.\n[0:47] Reggie Miller: Tobias Harris with a fadeaway jumper, and it's good! That should give the 76ers some momentum.\n[0:53] Kevin Harlan: And Marcus Smart with a turnover! The 76ers are taking advantage of the Celtics' mistakes.\n[0:58] Reggie Miller: Harden with a step-back jumper, and it's good! He's really carrying the 76ers right now.\n[1:03] Kevin Harlan: And another turnover by the Celtics! P.J. Tucker with the steal, and Harris with an alley-oop dunk!\n[1:09] Reggie Miller: The 76ers are starting to build a lead here in the first quarter.\n[1:14] Kevin Harlan: Tatum with a missed shot, and Reed with a block! The 76ers' defense is really stepping up.\n[1:20] Reggie Miller: But Horford with the rebound, and he passes it to Brown for a three-point shot! Celtics are back in it.\n[1:26] Kevin Harlan: Harden with a fadeaway jumper, and it's good again! He's really feeling it tonight.\n[1:31] Reggie Miller: And another turnover by the Celtics! They need to clean up their game if they want to stay in this.\n[1:36] Kevin Harlan: Harden with a step-back three-pointer, and it's good! He's unstoppable right now.\n[1:42] Reggie Miller: The 76ers are really dominating this first quarter.\n[1:47] Kevin Harlan: And White with a driving layup for the Celtics! They needed that one.\n[1:52] Reggie Miller: That was a great play by White, but the 76ers are still in control of this game."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
